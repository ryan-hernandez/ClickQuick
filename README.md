# ClickQuick

## About
ClickQuick is a mini-game created by me in order to learn the basics of Processing using Java.

## How to Play
To play, simply click the randomly generated circles of varying sizes as quickly as you can. The game tracks how long it takes you to make the current click, the number of successful clicks you've made, and the average amount of time (in seconds) it takes you to successfully click the circle.
